# Refresher Tasks
## Designed to test your competency with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

In each case, you should create a new HTML file. Any CSS and JavaScript should be contained in the same file. 

Feel free to make use of online resources to help you complete these tasks. 

## 1. 
Create a page that has a filled red square in the top left corner.

## 2.
Create a page that has a square with a dashed border in the middle of the page.

## 3.
Create a page with three paragraphs of text, the first letter of each being large and purple. 

## 4.
Create a page with three red squares, distributed equally across the full width of the browser with space around them at either end. 

## 5.
Create a page that mimics the Danish flag, filling the page, and so that it resizes as the browser window changes size.
(bonus points: do the same but for the Icelandic flag)

## 6.
Create a page that contains a video using the `<video>` element. It should have a poster image and use all three file formats.

## 7. 
Create a page with a blue square that:
* turns blue when the mouse hovers over it
* turns back to blue when the mouse is no longer over it
* transitions both changes over 0.3 seconds

## 8.
Create a page with a box with a 0 in it. Every second, the number in the box goes up by 1. 

## 9.
Create a page with a green square that starts off in the top left corner but moves 50 pixels to the right every time it's clicked. 
(Bonus points: start the square in the middle of the page and move it in a random direction with each click)

## 10.
Create a page with a blue square and a red square. Clicking on either square swaps their colours.
