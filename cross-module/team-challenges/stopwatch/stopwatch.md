# Team Challenge
## Mobile Stopwatch

Your challenge is to produce an online stopwatch for smartphones. 

This challenge is designed to include a minimal amount of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing you to focus on producing a product that works well and looks good. 

The stopwatch should include:

* A digital display of the time
* Buttons to start, stop, and reset (note: this doesn't necessarily mean three buttons)

The stopwatch should be built to look right on a smartphone. 

An image search for 'Stopwatch App' should give you some inspiration to get started.

The winning team will be the one that produces a stopwatch that:

1. Works correctly
2. Looks the best

As voted for by the rest of the lab group.
