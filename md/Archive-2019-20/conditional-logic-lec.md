Conditions evaluate to either **true** or **false**

| Comparison | Example | Description |
| ---------- | ------- | ----------- |
| < | a < b | a is less than b |
| > | a > b | a is greater than b |
| <= | a <= b | a is less than or equal to b |
| >= | a >= b | a is greater than or equal to b |
| == | a == b | a is equivalent to b |
| === | a === b | a is strictly equal to b |
| != | a != b | a is not equivalent to b |
| !== | a !== b | a is not strictly equal to b |
