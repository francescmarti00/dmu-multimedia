# Introduction to Style

This lab guides you through steps to start experimenting with style in your webpages.

This lab sheet provides the steps, but doesn't tell you how to do them.  

As you work your way through the tasks, use the internet, each other, and your tutor where you get stuck.

Refresh your page in Chrome regularly to make sure it's all working as you go along.

### 1. Create a folder for this task

### 2. Open the folder in Atom

### 3. In Atom, create a new HTML file inside that folder
Don't forget the file extension!

### 4. Start off with the standard boilerplate html

### 5. Create a folder for your css files

### 6. Link your css file into your html file
Ok, this is perhaps starting to get a little tricky. You need to use a `<link>` element here, placed in the `<head>` section of your html page.

### 7. Insert a paragraph of text in to the body of your webpage

### 8. Change the background colour of your page
This is it, your first bit of style!!!

### 9. Change the font used.

### 10. Open up the Inspector (also called Developer Tools) in Chrome.
In the elements tab, select the paragraph and notice the css rules being applied to it. You're is there, as well as all the browser defaults.

## Layout
So far you've linked in a stylesheet and made a couple of basic visual changes. Now it's time to tackle layout.

### 1. Develop your page so that you have the following layout.

### 2. Set the background colour of the `<section>`s
This helps you to clearly see where they are when developing your layout.

### 3. Apply padding to the `<section>`s to indent the text
It doesn't look good right up to the edge of the sections, particularly on the left and right.

### 4. Make your `<article>` half the width of the window
Text that stretches across the full width of the screen is a bit difficult to read.

### 5. Centre your `<article>` in the middle of the page
Do some searching for this, but as a hint you want to set left and right margins to auto.

### 6. Add a third `<section>` at the bottom with a `<p>` in it.
This will be our footer, so put something like a copywrite notice in here.

### 7. Change the background colour of that section to dark grey

### 8. Make the text in the paragraph smaller than the rest of the text
This is going to require that you select just this paragraph, and not the others.

### 9. Tidy it all up a bit
You probably don't actually want the those first two sections to have a background colour. Instead, maybe the `<article>` should have it. Maybe you need to change some padding or margins somewhere too?

## Where Now?
The world is your oyster. You could look through the list of css properties available on [w3Schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/default.asp), or you could have a particular idea in mind and try to achieve it.
