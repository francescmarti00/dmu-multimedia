# Embedding Media

This lab will take you through sourcing, preparing, and embedding video and audio content in your webpage.

## Audio

### 1. Get some audio
Head to <https://freesound.org>, sign up for a free account, and download some audio. Ideally in wav format.

### 2. Convert it
If you've got a wav file, you also need it as mp3 and ogg. There are free online converters such as <https://online-audio-converter.com>
Be wary - don't use any that require you download their software.   
If the converted file you download doesn't have a file extension you expect (.mp3, .wav, or .ogg) delete it and head somewhere else.

You should now have the same audio clip in three formats.

### 3. Create a new HTML file
Starting with a week4 folder, open in Atom and create the file with the usual bits.

### 4. Add the `<audio>` element
You'll find some good pointers at <https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_audio.asp> to help with this.

### 5. Make the audio play automatically when the page loads

### 6. Make it loop

## Video

### 1. Get a video
Head to <https://www.videvo.net>, download a video. Ideally in mp4 format.

### 2. Convert it
If you've got an mp4 file, you also need it as webm and ogv. There are free online converters such as <https://util.clipchamp.com>
Be wary - don't use any that require you download their software.   
If the converted file you download doesn't have a file extension you expect (.mp4, .webm, or .ogv) delete it and head somewhere else.

You should now have the same video clip in three formats.

### 3. Create a new HTML file
Create a new file in that week4 folder with the usual bits.

### 4. Add the `<video>` element
You'll find some good pointers at <https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_video.asp> to help with this.

### 5. Make the audio play automatically when the page loads

### 6. Make it loop

### 7. Create a poster image
Make sure it's the same aspect ratio as the video

### 8. Set it as the poster for the video

## Create a Full Page
Now you've successfully embedding both audio and video, it's time to incorporate them into a whole page. What the page is about will depend on the video you've got.  

Your page will have a header, some intro text, and the video, as per the layout below.

The styling is completely up to you!
