# File Extensions

- Websites are comprised of files <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- The browser needs to know exactly what those files are <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- It does that using the file extension <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

# File Names

File names actually have two parts.

<span class="fragment fade-in">teddy</span><span class="fragment fade-in">.jpg</span>  
<span class="fragment fade-in">week2</span><span class="fragment fade-in">.html</span>  
<span class="fragment fade-in">saturday</span><span class="fragment fade-in">.mp4</span>

Every file has an extension, but the operating system doesn't usually show it to you.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## What happens if you don't add the extension?

## Don't put spaces in file names

# Text

We are concerned with two types of text file:

- html
- css

---

# HTML = Data Representation

HTML describes the content and its structure with text.

What do we mean by content and structure?

Lets look at an example
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page>

---

# To Recap

- We need to be explicit with the computer
- We need to make media choices carefully
- HTML = content and its structure

# Any Questions?
