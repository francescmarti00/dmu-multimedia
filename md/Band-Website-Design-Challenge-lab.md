# Band Website Design Challenge

Your task is to design a mobile website for a band. They have a good deal of content they would like including. You can find it here: <https://thomcorah.github.io/dmu-multimedia/resources/BandWebsiteDesignChallengeResources.zip>

You should use your knowledge of design principles and information architecture to ensure that your design is easy to use, consistent, and organised.

## 1. Review the material

The band have produced a brief containing all the info and content they would like including. Review this. Consider how it might be logically grouped or arranged.

Apply the principles of Information Architecture to help you get derive a logical structure for the website. Some questions to answer:

- How many pages are there
- What are they called
- How do they relate to each other
- How will they be labelled in menus for the user
- How will the information and content in them be presented
- What are the likely needs of the user of this website
  - What will they want to do with the content
  - Which content is more important to them

You might like to create diagrams, use post-it-notes (real or virtual), or otherwise note your process and final structure.

## 2. Wireframe

Wireframes are a great step to take once you've got an understanding of what the content is and how that will be organised into pages.

They can help you work out issues such as content placement, page flow, and test the navigation you propose.

## 3. Prototype

Wireframes can become high-fidelity prototypes by building in interactions and navigation transitions, included copy, graphics, and images.

## 4. Share and test

Having produced an interactive prototype, you should share this in order to get feedback.
