# Information Architecture

This activity is all about Information Architecture, the practice of really thinking about how you structure and present the information contained in a web site. To that end, your main task today centres around developing a data structure for a budget airline’s website.

You’re given a list of content for the website. You should think carefully about how each of these will be described in the short space afforded by a menu item. You will then arrange them into logical groupings, devising a menu structure using a card sorting exercise. Finally, you will test that structure out using a tree test.

## The Content

In no particular order, the airline’s website needs to contain the following pages and information:

- the airline partners with car hire firms in all its destinations to offer discounted rates to customers
- information about baggage allowances and fares
- information about transferring between flights, including which ones are automatic i.e the airport moves your bags onto the next plane
- information on parking at the airports used by the airline
- the airline offers gift vouchers for redemption against flight costs
- information about the deals available on travel insurance
- what the airline can do for business users
- discounts available to group bookings and information for schools, community groups, and sports teams
- plug in where you want to go and when and find options and costs for flights
- an interactive map showing all the routes the airline flies
- information about the destinations the airline flies too. Hotels, things to do, sights to see and so on
- information on the priority service available to customers that enables them to skip queues and such like
- information about the airline’s smartphone and tablet apps
- the airline offers online check in within 1 month of travel, so there needs to be a check in option
- a place for a customer to manage their bookings - requires login.

You need to come up with a heading for each that will be both succinct enough to provide a menu item, but also describes enough of what information it leads to.

Once you have your headings, it’s time to think about how these might be arranged into some kind of navigational structure. This is where a card sorting exercise can prove useful. You can do this manually, ripping up some paper into squares and writing a heading on each. Or you can use an online tool such as that provided by Optimal Workshop to create something you can share remotely:

Note: You'll need sign up for a free account - unlimited time but restricted in the number of responses you can get to 10.

The aim of this exercise is to have lots of potential users sort the headings into logical groupings. The strength here is in numbers as you’re looking to spot trends in the way the cards are sorted. So, co-opt others into sorting your cards. If you’ve used Optimal Sort, you can invite people to do this in a browser. Be aware though that you need to get this done now, otherwise you can’t really continue with this in the lab.

Once you’ve had lots (or some) of people sort your cards, you should have a pretty good idea of how you might group this list of pages under headings on the website. This is really crucial as there are clearly too many options to display them all at once. Each of those groupings will need a name, the item that gets displayed in the main menu that leads to all members of the group.
If you’ve done the card sort manually, you might also have an idea of how effective your headings are. Perhaps people asked you what you meant by ‘Mapz’ for example, causing you to reevaluate if this is really the best heading for the interactive destinations map.

## Testing the Structure

Now that you’ve got what you think is an unambiguous menu structure sorted out, it’s time to test it. This is where Tree Testing comes in really handy. You may not be surprised to know that Optimal Workshop also offer tree testing.

You plug in your menu structure and the service will present this to users in a very plain way. No fancy styling and what not. You can also set a range of tasks that you would like users to be able to complete. For example:
“Find information about whether you can take your baby’s pushchair on-board”

The user then has to navigate your menu structure and mark whichever item they think will give them that information. Do this a load of times and you’ve got a pretty good idea if your headings and structure are meaningful enough to allow a user to find what they’re after.

So, do this. Again, you can do this manually, though it will be slightly more complex than ripping some paper into squares. Think of 5 or 6 key questions that will set a user off trying to find a specific piece of information or carry out a particular task. Get some people to do it and record what they get right and wrong. If you’ve used an online tool, you’ll likely get some fancy graphs to help you decipher the data.

## Going Further

If you get that done, there are now a couple of options open to you.

1. Do some work on Coursework 1.
2. Attempt to make your own online tree testing setup. This is really about two things:
3. Present an interactive menu structure to a user
4. Log which menu item they select
5. Optionally, can you also build in the tasks functionality?

## Conclusion

Information Architecture is a rich and fruitful activity that crosses many traditional fields. It yields extremely useful insights into your users and the way they think, allowing you to tailor your website more closely to their needs. You don’t need to go to extraordinary lengths to take advantage of the core of the process, as we’ve seen here, which makes it an accessible part of even small-scale projects.
