In order to activate it, you need to open the Inspector or Developer Tools. Right-click anywhere on your page and select Inspect. This will open a panel of tools. In the top-left of this panel is a small button that represents a phone in front of a tablet. Click this, and your page display will shrink to a mobile view.
