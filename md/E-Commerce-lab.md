# E-Commerce

In this lab we're going to make an online t-shirt shop. Here's what it's going to do/be:

- list three different t-shirt designs
- let the user add them to a cart
- display the cart
- allow the user to select the size they want
- proceed to checkout
- let the user checkout, with dummy card details, and get an email confirmation
