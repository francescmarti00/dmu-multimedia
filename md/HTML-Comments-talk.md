# HTML Comments

Comments can describe and discuss your code, where the code appears.

## What Are Comments

Comments are bits of text that you can write in a code file (such as HTML) that will be ignored when your code is used. In our case, we can write text in our HTML file that the browser will ignore. The same is true with other programming languages, though the format varies.

## Why Write Them?

Comments can be useful for a number of reasons, all centred around the fact that they describe your code, alongside the code they describe.

You might find this useful to help remind you what you were trying to do, or to describe code to somebody who might have to work on what you've done at a later date.

It can be surprisingly easy to come back to code you wrote a week ago and completely forget what you were thinking. This means you have to spend some time going back through your code to understand what's going on before you can actually do the work you sat down to do.

## How Do I Write Them

In order to write a comment, we need to make it clear to the browser where our comment starts and ends. To start a comment, use the following sequence of characters:

`<!--`

To end a comment, we do nearly the opposite:

`-->`

For example, here is a complete comment:

```HTML
<!-- This is a comment. The browser will ignore it.-->
```

You can write these anywhere in your HTML, usually right above the HTML that they are describing.
