# JavaScript Refresher Tasks

These tasks will help get you back up to speed with the basics of JavaScript.

## 1. Alerting Button

Create a `<button>` on the page. When the user clicks it, an alert should show with some text in it.

For Example: <https://francescmarti00.github.io/dmu-multimedia/resources/js-refresher-tasks/1.html>

## 2. Alert the Input

Duplicate your code for 1. above. Add an `<input>` element. Now, when the user clicks the button, the alert should show whatever text is contained in the `<input>`.

For Example: <https://francescmarti00.github.io/dmu-multimedia/resources/js-refresher-tasks/2.html>

## 3. Changing Image

Get three image files. Your page should display each of them as a small thumbnail. A fourth `<img>` element will be larger, but initially blank. When the user clicks one of the thumbnails, the larger `<img>` element is set to show that image.

For Example: <https://francescmarti00.github.io/dmu-multimedia/resources/js-refresher-tasks/3.html>

## 4. Changing Background Colour

Put a dropdown menu on a page using a `<select>` element. Each option of the `<select>` should be a colour. When the user selects a colour, the background colour of the page updates accordingly.

For Example: <https://francescmarti00.github.io/dmu-multimedia/resources/js-refresher-tasks/4.html>

## 5. Constantly Changing Background Colour

Create an array of colours. A timer updates the background colour of an element to a randomly selected entry in the colour array every second.

For Example: <https://francescmarti00.github.io/dmu-multimedia/resources/js-refresher-tasks/5.html>
