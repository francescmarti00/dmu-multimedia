# Working with video with p5.js

## Loading and displaying video with p5.js.

The p5.js library makes it easy to load, display and control video playback from your sketch. Letâ€™s see an example.

As always, we are going to use two files, an HTML file and a Javascript file. Remember to run the examples on localhost, to avoid problems. 

This is the 'empty' HTML file

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>p5.js video</title>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/p5@1.4.1/lib/p5.min.js"></script>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/p5@1.4.1/lib/addons/p5.sound.js"></script>
  <script src="sketch.js"></script>
</head>

<body>
  <main>
  </main>
</body>

</html>
```

And this is the Javascript file

```JS
let vid;
let playing = false;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(0, 0);
  vid = createVideo("Commercial_1958.mp4");
}

function draw() {
}

function mousePressed() {
  if (!playing) {
    vid.play();
    // vid.loop();
    playing = true;
  }
  else {
    vid.pause();
    playing = false;
  }
}
```

## Video Capture

Capture video from the webcam and display on the canvas is also straightforward with p5.js.

Let's study this code

```JS
let capture;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(0, 0);
  capture = createCapture(VIDEO);
  capture.size(320, 240);
}

function draw() {
  background(255);
}
```

## Video filters

p5.js inclludes some filters, ready to use, such as INVERT.

```JS
let capture;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(320, 240);
  capture = createCapture(VIDEO);
  capture.size(320, 240);
  //capture.hide();
}

function draw() {
  background(255);
  image(capture, 0, 0, 320, 240);
  filter(INVERT);
}
```

**Exercise 1**
Investigate the function filter() (<https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/filter>) and add the following filters to the captured image: THRESHOLD, GRAY, OPAQUE, INVERT, POSTERIZE, BLUR, ERODE and DILATE.

## Working with video pixels
  
```JS
let capture;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(320, 240);
  capture = createCapture(VIDEO);
  capture.size(320, 240);
  capture.hide();
}

function draw() {
  background(255);

  capture.loadPixels();
  for (let y=0; y<capture.height; y++) {
    for (let x=0; x<capture.width; x++) {
      let position = ((capture.width * y + x)*4);
      let r = capture.pixels[position];
      let g = capture.pixels[position+1];
      let b = capture.pixels[position+2];
    }
  }
  capture.updatePixels();
  
  image(capture, 0, 0, 320, 240);
}
```
  
## Pixel-to-pixel operations
  
The simplest image processing operations are those that transform each pixel in isolation, i.e. the transformation of a pixel does not depend on the surrounding pixels, it depends only on the value of the image f at the pixel (x,y). These operations are called pixel-to-pixel operations.

For example, we can remove one of the colour components of the pixels.

```JS
let capture;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(320, 240);
  capture = createCapture(VIDEO);
  capture.size(320, 240);
  capture.hide();
}

function draw() {
  background(255);

  capture.loadPixels();
  for (let y=0; y<capture.height; y++) {
    for (let x=0; x<capture.width; x++) {
      let position = ((capture.width * y + x)*4);
      let r = capture.pixels[position];
      let g = capture.pixels[position+1];
      let b = capture.pixels[position+2];
      
      capture.pixels[position] = 0;
    }
  }
  capture.updatePixels();
  
  image(capture, 0, 0, 320, 240);
}
```

**Exercise 2**
Repeat the previous program but removing the blue component of the pixels.

**Exercise 3**
Make a filter to brighten your webcam image.
  
**Exercise 4**
Make a filter to darken your webcam image.

**Exercise 5**
There are several methods to transform an RGB image to a grayscale image. For example:

The luminosity method: this is the method used in the aforementioned example. If you check the code, you can see that the formula that defines this transformation is

Grayscale = 0.2126*r + 0.7152*g + 0.0722*b

The weighted method: this method is defined by the formula

Grayscale = 0.299*r + 0.587*g + 0.114*b

The average method: this method takes the average value of R, G, and B as the grayscale value

Grayscale = r/3 + g/3 + b/3

Make a filter to transform an RGB image to a grayscale image using the luminosity method.

**Exercise 6**
Make a 'custom filter' combining pixel-to-pixel operations and the function filter().

## More advanced filters 

Study the following example.

```JS
/*
VIDEO PIXELS
Jeff Thompson | 2021 | jeffreythompson.org

Video input is basically just like an image!
We can get it's width and height, and access
the frame's pixel values too!

BASED ON
https://p5js.org/examples/dom-video-pixels.html

*/

let video;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);

  // webcam capture (at the size of the window)
  video = createCapture(VIDEO);
  video.size(width, height);
  video.hide();
}

function draw() { 
  background(255);

  // try experimenting with this
  let gridSize = int(map(mouseX, 0,width, 15,50));

  // the video has pixels just like an image!
  video.loadPixels();
  for (let y=0; y<video.height; y+=gridSize) {
    for (let x=0; x<video.width; x+=gridSize) {
      
      // at the current position, get the red
      // value (an approximation for brightness)
      // and use it to create the diameter
      let index = (y * video.width + x) * 4;
      let r = video.pixels[index];
      let dia = map(r, 0,255, gridSize,2);
      
      // draw a circle at the current location
      // using the diameter we calculated
      fill(0);
      noStroke();
      circle(x+gridSize/2,y+gridSize/2, dia);
    }
  } 
}
```

**Exercise 7**
Modify the previous code and fill the circles with the pixel color instead of black.
