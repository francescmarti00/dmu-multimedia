# Semantic HTML Elements

There are a number of HTML elements you can use to simply convey some meaning about what they contain. These can be useful tools in better describing the contents and structure of your page to browsers, screen readers, and search engines.

## Article

The `<article>` element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or any site and is, in principle, independently distributable or reusable.

## Section

The `<section>` element represents a generic section of a document or application. A section, in this context, is a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading.

## Nav

The `<nav>` element defines a navigation section i.e. a section that contains links to other parts of the site or places on the page.

## Aside

An `<aside>` contains information that is tangentially related to the main page content.

## Footer

A `<footer>` element is used at the bottom of a `<section>`, `<article>` or `<page>`. It often contains a copyright notice, quick links, or other information.
