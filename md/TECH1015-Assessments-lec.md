## Informal Assessment

This assessment is not part of your module grade, but provides an opportunity for your tutors to ensure you are picking up the basics in the first five weeks and to help identify any areas for improvement moving forward. As such, it is a simple task completed as you undertake the lab work.

Through weeks 1-5 you will complete a series of short tasks that build towards the completion of a simple webpage. This will be assessed from week 6, enabling you to get some feedback as you move forward with the module.
