## Welcome to Multimedia I

I hope you enjoy studying this module through your first year and find that you learn many valuable skills from it. It is a modern reality that many creative disciplines can be enhanced with at least a working knowledge of how the web works. An incredible amount of content is now delivered over the Internet, from short form videos to full blockbusters, from amateur audio clips to professional albums, images, radio, applications and more. Whether you’re a videographer, sound engineer, animator or editor, an understanding of the web should be a key component of your skillset.

Arguably, this is more important now than ever. Coronavirus has moved more activity online, and forced creatives in to rethinking how the produce and present their work.

Speaking of which, this is also a more difficult time than usual to be starting university. We've tried to produce and deliver this module in a way that enables you to pursue in the manner in which you feel most comfortable. Please do talk to us if we've missed something, or we can do things differently.

We’re very open to comments, good and bad, that will help to shape and improve the module. Similarly, if you’re having problems keeping up or don’t understand a particular concept, please get in touch as soon as possible and we’ll be able to help you more easily.

Some of you may of created websites with HTML before and some won’t. For those that haven’t, don’t worry. We start from the very beginning and build things up at a pace that you can deal with. If you would like extra help, get in touch.

## Module Description

This module will launch you into the world of presenting interesting and interactive online experiences. The ability to be able to turn ideas into digital realities is becoming increasingly important in a range of industries, and so this module will seek to equip you with some fundamental skills in HTML authoring and online interactivity. We take a look at creating styled webpages with the languages of HTML and CSS, before dipping a toe into the language of Javascript to add a little more oomph to the page.

An initial run of lectures will lay some theoretical groundwork for what is to come. Practical skills will be developed through hands-on learning and practice at the workstation, supported by experienced lab tutors and demonstrations.

Throughout the module you are encouraged to undertake your own research into the software and practices we use. You should develop the ability to solve problems encountered in your work in an independent fashion, though your lab tutor will step in if necessary.

## Blackboard – Virtual Learning Environment

This module makes use of Blackboard – De Montfort University’s Virtual Learning Environment. It is important that you access Blackboard regularly to keep up to date with:

- Assessments
- Lab activities
- Lecture notes
- Your assessment feedback
- General notices and announcements
- Lecture and lab recordings

Access to Blackboard can be found at:

<https://www.blackboard.dmu.ac.uk>

<a name="plagiarism"></a>

## Plagiarism

DMU defines plagiarism as “the deliberate attempt to gain advantage by presenting any work, data or concepts (including drafts and work in progress) that are not the student’s own as if they were”. The University takes a very serious stance against copying other people’s work without giving the proper credit.

You can read more about plagiarism and other acedemic offences in Chapter 4 of the student regulations: <https://www.dmu.ac.uk/documents/dmu-students/academic-support-office/student-regulations/chapter-4-17.18.pdf>

If you use somebody else’s work, either as research or directly, always attribute the author/artist/musician etc in the proper way. In this module we use the Harvard Referencing style. Directions on the use of the Harvard referencing system can be found through the library website: <http://www.library.dmu.ac.uk/Images/Selfstudy/Harvard.pdf>

If you are found to of copied work without crediting the source you are likely to face a disciplinary panel and could see your mark reduced to 0, or worse in extreme cases.

If you have any questions regarding plagiarism and other academic practice offences, you can email Leicester Media School's Academic Practice Officer Helen Ackerley at <hackerley@dmu.ac.uk>.

<a name='assessment'></a>

## Assessment

You will be assessed continuously through the module with formal feedback given at two key points through the year as well as informally in labs. There is also an informal assessment that you should complete through weeks 1-5 that will be assessed in week 6.

### Informal Assessment

This assessment is not part of your module grade, but provides an opportunity for your tutors to ensure you are picking up the basics in the first five weeks and to help identify any areas for improvement moving forward. As such, it is a simple task completed as you undertake the lab work.

### Coursework 1

Worth 40% of the module grade, your first summative coursework is an individual task. It will test the core skills learnt through much of the first semester seeing you produce a simple two-page website. Due in at the beginning of week 12, it’ll give you a chance to reflect what you have learnt so far before heading into Coursework 2.

### Coursework 2

Worth 60% of the module grade this coursework will tackle more advanced web technologies to have you produce a simple website of your own design from scratch. This coursework is much more open-ended: you choose what you're making, so there's plenty of scope to try out things that interest you. This is due in at the beginning of week 31, just after the end of teaching. Note that the proposal portion is due earlier, by midday on Monday 8th February.

### Some notes on assessment submissions

All written submissions (i.e. reports and documentation) should be submitted through Turnitin. You will find a link to submit your report through the Assessment section on Blackboard.

You will be required to create a logical folder structure on your public server to which you will upload your practical work for marking. Follow the instructions for structure and naming exactly, and don’t put anything there that shouldn’t be marked. If your tutor is in any doubt as to where your work is, it may not get marked.

Make sure the names of all files on your public server include only letters, numbers, underscores and hyphens. No spaces, no slashes!

If you are unsure about any details of an assessment, ask your lab tutor.

To reiterate:

All written work through Turnitin  
All practical work uploaded to your public server space

## Informal Assessment

### Overview

The informal assessment task is to produce a simple one-page website about yourself. This will be completed piece-by-piece through the first five weeks of the module, seeing you put learnt skills into practice as you go.

Your tutors will then assess this from week 6, providing you with feedback that you may find useful as you progress further through the module. We have found that the first five weeks are crucial to success in the module, with students who engage each week much more likely to get a solid grasp of the principles involved and go on to produce better coursework.

Although this assessment will not give you a mark that contributes towards your module grade, it will enable us to better support you towards the coursework that does effect your grade, and help you to continue the module with a strong foundation.

### The Tasks

The tasks for this assessment are split across the first five weeks, so that by the end of week 5 you will have a simple one-page website published on the internet. Those tasks in brief are:

#### Week 1

Create a HTML page with heading and a paragraph of text. Make it mobile-friendly. Publish it on Github, and add your tutors as collaborators.

#### Week 2

Add a list, subheadings, and HTML comments to the page.

#### Week 3

Add a link and an image to your page.

#### Week 4

Add either an audio or video clip to your page.

#### Week 5

Add style to your page. Change at least the text and the background colour(s).

#### For Example

As an example, your finished webpage might look something like this, though obviously with your own details in.

### Overview

Coursework 1 is an individual piece of web work that will see you demonstrate knowledge and use of the core principles of media presentation through the web. To this end, you will create a two page website showcasing a film. This will include imagery, audio and video content, as well as a simple style. Alongside the practical work, you will also submit documentation that evaluates your finished work.

**All written work must be submitted through the Turnitin link on Blackboard**

The submission deadline for this work is midday on Monday 21st December! You are encouraged to seek feedback from your lab tutor throughout the first semester on your ongoing work. You may have the opportunity in lab sessions to complete work towards this assignment should you finish the prescribed task for that session early, though don’t rely on this.

Coursework 1 is worth 40% of your module mark.

### The Task

You are to produce a two page website for an upcoming film. Which film this is remains up to you. It can be new, old, or made up. From the viewers’ point of view, several things should be included:

- A trailer for the film
  - so you’ll need to include video
- At least one audio interview
  - so you’ll need to include audio
- Images of key cast
  - so you’ll need some images in there
- A synopsis of the film
  - so you’ve got some text content

Your website will be across two pages. The first page will include the synopsis and trailer. The second page will have cast pictures and audio interviews.

You don’t need to include the real trailer, or real interviews with the task, but they do need to be actual video and audio files. You’re being marked on how you include these, not the quality of the media itself.

There is a prescribed layout for each of the two pages. You should use CSS to attempt to achieve these layouts. The fonts, colours, and other embellishments are up to you.

![Required Website Layout](https://thomcorah.github.io/dmu-multimedia/resources/img/TECH1015CW1Layout.png)

While you can add to this for better visual clarity, such as by boxing up each row of cast information and adding more rows, you should maintain as much of this layout as possible. The menu will only have two options in it, one for each page.

The footer should contain your student p number.

You should pay close attention to the marking criteria below for the specific points you will be marked on.

You should write HTML and CSS comments throughout your code to explain what you've done and why. This will convey to your tutor the degree to which you understand your work and will form part of your mark.

If you’re at all unsure about what you are meant to do, ask your lab tutor for guidance.

### The Evaluation

You are also to produce a 400 word evaluative report alongside your practical work.

This should include feedback from peers. You’ll see from the marking criteria that you’ll lose marks if you don’t include this. Ideally, you’ll have a range of people try out your website and then provide structured feedback on it. You might want to create a questionnaire that has a few questions soliciting a numerical answer (quality of design between 1 and 5, clarity of content etc) and then a couple of opportunities for the user to provide some more text-based feedback. You should then include this data in your report, and very importantly, comment on it.

You should then go on to form your own critical opinion of your work, building in reflection on your peer feedback. You need to be able to stand back from your work and be objective about it. This is crucial. What works about your site, what doesn’t. What did you find difficult, or what did you fail to achieve. Be completely honest. You wont lose any marks for pointing out something that doesn’t work. Indeed, you’ll gain marks for having a good critical approach.

Again, ask your lab tutor if you are at all unsure about what you should be writing.

### Submission

Your work should be submitted in two places, before midday on Monday 21st December.

#### Turnitin

Turnitin is a facility that allows for the submission of documentation and includes a similarity checker to ensure your work is original. Your evaluation should be submitted through the Turnitin link available on the module Blackboard shell. You'll find it in the Assessments section.

#### GitHub

In order to be able to view your website through a web server, you should transfer your website to your GitHub account, with its complete folder structure intact. On doing so, you should view your website through the server to ensure that all links and media still work.  
**Do not make any changes after the deadline**

### Marking Criteria

There are two components here, the website and the documentation, so each is marked separately.

#### Website

The website makes up 70% of your mark. You have to demonstrate a number of principles. You will receive a mark for each depending on the degree to which you successfully achieve this. They are:

**Include Images**  
Full marks for at least three images included using the `<img>` element, with suitable alt text, and originals that are close to the final display size of the image.

**Include Audio**  
Full marks for the inclusion of audio using the `<audio>` element with at least two different file formats properly used and a fallback for browsers that don't support it.

**Include Video**  
Full marks for the inclusion of video using the `<video>` element, with at least two different file formats properly used, a poster image in place, and a fallback for browsers that don't support it.

**Separate Style Sheet**  
Full marks for using a single .css file that uses properly formed CSS and linking it to both pages of the website.

**Well Formed and Appropriate Markup**  
Full marks for a site that has properly written HTML and makes full use of HTML semantic elements such as `nav`.

**Interlinking**  
Full marks for successfully linking the two pages together, and providing at least one link to an external page i.e. other website(s).

**Layout Implementation**  
Full marks for using CSS to successfully achieve the given layout.

For each of these seven criteria you will receive a mark out of 10, giving you a total out of 70.

### Documentation

The documentation is worth 30% of the coursework grade. For the purposes of marking, the code comments in your website are considered in this section. You will be marked against three criteria, again with a mark out of 10 for each one:

**Justification of Choices**  
Your website code should include HTML and CSS comments that describe what you have done and why. This should clearly justify the choices you have made and the approaches you have taken, showing a clear understanding of your code.

**Consideration of Third-Party Feedback**  
You should seek opinion from others on the quality of your work and reflect on this. Have a handful of people use your site and complete a short questionnaire for example. Include the results, but then go on to discuss them.

**Quality of Self-Evaluation**  
A good evaluation will demonstrate an ability to stand back from your work and critically evaluate it. What worked, what didn’t, and what could be improved.

**Your report should be 400 words, plus appropriate screenshots and charts.**

### Overview

In semester 1 you produced an individual piece of web work. For this coursework you will produce a full mobile website or mobile web-based application.

The actual website or application you produce is up to you. You are encouraged to develop something that you will find personally interesting. Some examples include:

- A portfolio website showcasing a range of creative work (audio, video, photography…)
- A website for a band that includes discography, live dates, and streams music from their latest release
- A website for a film that includes a trailer as well as interviews with the cast and a countdown to release
- A digital story that allows the reader to follow a range of paths through the narrative, incorporating graphics, audio, and video
- A simple web-based game

Some key points to consider include:

- The stylistic design of the site including colour and font choices.
- The use of text copy
- The inclusion of social media options for sharing
- The usability and accessibility of the website
- Your target audience and what this means for the site design
- Use of graphics, audio, animation and video
- Demonstration of the techniques covered in the module

The content should be your own. All content that is not yours (images, music, sound effects, etc.) should be appropriately referenced at a minimum in a list in the documentation (note that Google, or other search engines are not sources of information). Failure to do so is plagiarism and may attract a penalty. This does not prevent you from getting your colleagues or tutor to criticise early drafts of your work before it is handed in / published.

Any content you produce for your website such as an audio interview will be marked primarily on its suitability for web deployment rather than its own production value. For example, a video that is stored at a much larger size than it is displayed at would be a no no. You have other modules where you are keenly assessed on the production value of your digital output. Speak to your tutor if you have any questions about this.

There are two main components to this coursework: the website itself and the associated documentation. The website attracts 60% of the mark for this coursework, and the documentation 40%.

### Web Site

**Weighting:** 60% of the coursework mark, broken down as follows.  
**Amount:** 3 pages or equivalent.

Your site should be accessible via your GitHub account. Your tutor **must** be added as a collaborator.

You should include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript comments as appropriate throughout your work. These comments should document what you have done and why. They will convey to your tutor the degree to which you understand your code, and will contribute towards your mark.

The website will be assessed on the following three points.

#### Content

**Weighting:** 15% of the coursework mark  
Your website content should be fit for purpose and appropriate. This includes all text, graphics, images, sounds, and videos. You should use the correct techniques for displaying these in modern web browsers and ensure that you are using disk space and bandwidth efficiently.

- Text content shows semantic structure e.g. headings, lists
- Careful selection, creation and editing of video and/or audio
- Awareness of loading speed and disk space e.g. no huge images
- Original content is credited and third-party content is referenced
- All images have appropriate alt attributes
- All audio and video content is included using the native HTML elements, with at least two formats provided, and a fall back for browsers that don't support the element.

#### Style

**Weighting:** 15% of the coursework mark  
Your website should demonstrate an effort to appeal to your intended audience and be consistent with your storyboards / designs. You should make appropriate use of CSS in order to properly style and layout your site.

- Style and layout reflect/have evolved from proposal
- Coherent overall design, colour and font choices
- Consistent design across pages
- Design and content matches the target audience
- Skilful use of CSS to style and arrange site elements
- CSS is in a single separate style sheet

#### Technical Skills

**Weighting:** 30% of the coursework mark  
Your web site should contain a variety of appropriate techniques that demonstrate your ability to apply the concepts you have learnt in this module.

- Evidence of intelligent ability to choose and code current website techniques
- Awareness of usability/accessibility (semantic HTML5 tags/colour choices/font sizes etc)
- All links work, media loads, site is consistent across browsers
- Demonstration of more advanced skills such as CSS animations and transitions or appropriate use of JavaScript.

**Note:** including a slideshow from W3Schools (for example) will get you no marks for the code as it is on W3Schools, but you will get credit for any effort on your part to integrate it with your site and changes you make to it.

### Documentation.

**Weighting:** 40% of the coursework mark, broken down as follows.  
**Word Count:** 300 words plus designs for the proposal, 500 words for the evaluation, plus appropriate screenshots.

Your documentation should consist of the following components. For the purposes of marking, the code comments in your website will be marked as part of your documentation. Note that there are two hand in dates for the documentation.

#### Proposal and Initial Designs

**Weighting:** 10% of the coursework mark  
**Due:** Submit via Turnitin by midday on Monday 8th February.
**Word Count:** 300 words

This should give an outline of your intended website, including:

- Description that includes an outline of your idea
- Target audience and what this means for the site design
- Initial designs for layout, look, and site structure with commentary

#### Production

**Weighting:** 10% of the coursework mark  
**Due:** Include as comments in your code

This should give a high degree of insight into the development of your website. Your comments should document what your code does and why at every point. It would be useful to include any discussion of alternative approaches as appropriate. For example, if you considered a different style of menu, why have you gone with what you've got.

Your comments should demonstrate a thorough understanding of what your code does.

Your comments should clearly show where you have used code from elsewhere, including a link to the source of the code. As well as for directly copied code, this also applies to code that has resulted from you following a tutorial.

#### Evaluation

**Weighting:** 20% of the coursework mark  
**Due:** Submit via Turnitin by midday on Tuesday 4th May

You should address the following points:

- Provide evidence of testing (e.g. all links work, media loads, the site is consistent across browsers).
- Provide evidence and a breakdown of structured user testing and feedback.
- Evaluate your work, with reference to testing where appropriate, and user feedback, describing:  
   _ Your achievements, refer back to the original aims, explain any changes to your original ideas and why or how they have happened.  
   _ Any limitations of your web site  
   _ Any improvements you would make to the site and why  
   _ Any problems you encountered along the way, with potential solutions where possible
