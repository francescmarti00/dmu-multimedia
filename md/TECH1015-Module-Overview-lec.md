# TECH1015 Module Overview

## What is Multimedia 1

This module will launch you into the world of presenting interesting and interactive online experiences. The ability to be able to turn ideas into digital realities is becoming increasingly important in a range of industries, and so this module will seek to equip you with some fundamental skills in HTML authoring and online interactivity. We take a look at creating styled webpages with the languages of HTML and CSS, before dipping a toe into the language of Javascript to add a little more oomph to the page.
