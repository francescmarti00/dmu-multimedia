# Supporting Your Learning

These are difficult and unprecedented times. You may have keen worries about your own health, or those you care for, or you may not. We wanted this module to be one which you can tackle in the way in which you feel most safe and comfortable.

## Labs

You'll see you have a lab on your timetable for this module. Ignore that. Instead, all labs through the week are open to anybody on the module. You can go to whichever one you want. Some of them are face-to-face, some of them are online. You can choose each week which one to attend.

We need to keep a cap on numbers though, so you'll need to book yourself onto the lab you want to go to. There are links on Blackboard for this. If you don't book a slot, you may not be allowed entry as the lab may be full.

Please see Blackboard for a timetable of labs and links to book a slot.

Each week you will have a series of practical demonstration videos and a guided task to complete. These will be released at the beginning of the week before the lab. You may complete the tasks and feel happy to continue without tutor support for that particular week, or you may wait until you're in the lab and then start the task - it's up to you.

## Lectures

As with your other modules, lectures will be entirely online and pre-recorded. There are just five lectures for this module, each split into a number of videos, just like this one. The links will be on Blackboard as they become available.

## Use the Internet

There are a wide range of helpful resources on the web for learning to create websites. You will find <https://w3schools.com> particularly helpful for example. There are more listed on Blackboard. Make use of them.

## Ask Questions

Ask each other, ask your tutors. There are no stupid questions (except the ones you don't ask).

In many ways we are finding our feet with new ways of doing things, so there's every chance we've not communicated something in a way that totally makes sense. Please do ask if that's the case.
