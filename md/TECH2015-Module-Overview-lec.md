## What is Multimedia 2

This module will build on your work last year in TECH1015 and develop your understanding of media presentation using the Internet. Last year was concerned with getting the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as some of the mechanics of the Internet. Through the course of this module youâ€™ll develop a more nuanced approach that will consider the needs of different users consuming your media through a range of platforms.

You will build on your technical understanding of the languages of the web: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Through these languages you will investigate issues of layout, style, animation, and interactivity, all with a keen focus on the user and the user experience. You will also make use of existing online resources, particularly those that can manage your media productions such as Vimeo and SoundCloud.

Throughout the module you are encouraged to undertake your own research in to the software and practices we undertake. You should develop the ability to solve problems encountered in your work in an independent fashion, though your lab tutor will step in if necessary.
