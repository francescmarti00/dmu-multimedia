# Supporting Your Learning

These are difficult and unprecedented times. You may have keen worries about your own health, or those you care for, or you may not. We wanted this module to be one which you can tackle in the way in which you feel most safe and comfortable.

## Labs

Each week you will have a lab for this module. These labs will take place in Q3.12 on Tuesdays 15:00 - 17:00.

## Lectures

There are no lectures for this module.

## Use the Internet

There are a wide range of helpful resources on the web for learning to create websites. You will find <https://w3schools.com> particularly helpful for example. There are more listed on Blackboard. Make use of them.

## Ask Questions

Ask each other, ask your tutors. There are no stupid questions (except the ones you don't ask).

In many ways we are finding our feet with new ways of doing things, so there's every chance we've not communicated something in a way that totally makes sense. Please do ask if that's the case.
