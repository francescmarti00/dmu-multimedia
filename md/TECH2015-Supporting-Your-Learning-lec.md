# Supporting Your Learning

These are difficult and unprecedented times. You may have keen worries about your own health, or those you care for, or you may not. We wanted this module to be one which you can tackle in the way in which you feel most safe and comfortable.

## Labs

You'll see you have a lab on your timetable for this module. Ignore that. There are two lab sessions in the week. I'll be running one as a face-to-face session and the other as an online session. Each week, choose the one you want to go to.

We need to keep a cap on numbers though, so you'll need to book yourself onto the lab you want to go to. There are links on Blackboard for this. If you don't book a slot, you may not be allowed entry as the lab may be full.

Please see Blackboard for a timetable of labs and links to book a slot.

Each week you will have a series of practical demonstration videos and a guided task to complete. These will be released at the beginning of the week before the lab. You may complete the tasks and feel happy to continue without tutor support for that particular week, or you may wait until you're in the lab and then start the task - it's up to you.

## Lectures

There are no lectures for this module. Instead, there is an additional 1hr online lab. This hasn't been timetabled though, so we need to work out where it can fit.

## Use the Internet

There are a wide range of helpful resources on the web for learning to create websites. You will find <https://w3schools.com> particularly helpful for example. There are more listed on Blackboard. Make use of them.

## Ask Questions

Ask each other, ask your tutors. There are no stupid questions (except the ones you don't ask).

In many ways we are finding our feet with new ways of doing things, so there's every chance we've not communicated something in a way that totally makes sense. Please do ask if that's the case.
