## Welcome to Multimedia III

I hope you enjoy studying this module through your final year and find that you learn many valuable skills from it. It is a modern reality that many creative disciplines can be enhanced with at least a working knowledge of how the web works. An incredible amount of content is now delivered over the Internet, from short form videos to full blockbusters, from amateur audio clips to platinum albums, images, radio, applications and more. Whether you’re a videographer, sound engineer, animator or editor, an understanding of the web should be a key component of your skillset.

Throughout the module please get in touch if you have anything to say on the content or the way we teach it. We’re very open to both positive and negative feedback — it helps to shape and improve the module. Similarly, if you’re having problems keeping up or don’t understand a particular concept, please let us know as soon as possible so we can help you as soon as possible.

## Module Description

This module will build on your work last year in TECH2015, as well as what you did in TECH1015 and develop your understanding of media presentation using the Internet. Through the course of this module you’ll develop a more nuanced approach that will consider the needs of different users consuming your media through a range of platforms.

You will build on your technical understanding of the languages of the web: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Through these languages you will investigate issues of layout, style, animation, and interactivity, all with a keen focus on the user and the user experience. You will also make use of existing online resources and data sources.

Throughout the module you are encouraged to undertake your own research into the software and practices we undertake. You should develop the ability to solve problems encountered in your work in an independent fashion, though your lab tutor will step in if necessary.

## How the Module Works

These are difficult and unprecedented times. You may have keen worries about your own health, or those you care for, or you may not. We wanted this module to be one which you can tackle in the way in which you feel most safe and comfortable.

### Practical Lab Sessions

In previous years, you would have a one hour lecture and a two hour lab session every week. However, we've changed this slightly.

The whole cohort have a single practical lab session together. This will alternate each week between face-to-face and online. If you would rather not attend any of the face-to-face sessions, that's fine. I'll have an online classroom open so that you can still pop in and ask questions, share code and so on.

The lab in week 1 will be face-to-face, and then alternate from there. I'll email you at the end of each week with a reminder of what we're doing the following Monday.

### Learning Materials

In past years, you'd walk into your lab session and we'd start off with your tutor giving a live demo at the front. You'd then work through a task that sees you learning whatever we're doing at that point. Ideally you'd finish before the end of the lab.

This year, things will be slightly different. There will be no live demo at the front of the room. Instead, we are producing a series of short explainers for each lab session. Each of these will discuss a particular 'thing', such as a HTML refresher for example, with both a video and a text version. There will then be a guided activity that will see you using those techniques. All of these will be available via Blackboard from the beginning of the week BEFORE the lab.

This means you can start on this at home really early. You can start on week 2 work as soon as you've finished your week 1 lab for example. You don't have to, but you can if you want, if that's what suits you. You might find you get to week 2 and it all made total sense and you don't need to go to the physical lab session. If that's the case, just check in with a tutor via email or pop online for a quick review.

### Lectures

As with all modules, lectures will be asynchronous through the whole module - this means they will be pre-recorded and made available the week before that for which they are intended. Please do watch these as they will communicate many of the practical techniques and technologies that you'll need to make use of for the lab work, and indeed, for your coursework.

### Recommended online resources

**NOTE:** learn to filter what you find and check the date as some resources (including W3Schools) contain outdated information. For HTML that could be (e.g.) `<div class="header">` instead of `<header>` and for JavaScript, using (e.g.) `var`, when `let` and `const` are current practice.

- **[stackoverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com)**  
  Question and answer site perhaps used by every developer ever. If you put a web development question into Google, chances are the answer will come up here. Check the date of answers and ask your tutor if unsure—some answers are not the best solutions!
- **[w3schools.com](http://www.w3schools.com)**  
  Detailed resource with mini tutorials and a great reference section for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. NOTE: check with your tutor that any JavaScript examples you want to use are current good practice, as not all the code is up-to-date.
- **[css-tricks.com](https://css-tricks.com)**  
  Really great website with loads of posts on stying your webpages and sites, all very well-explained.
- **[codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com)** Free high-quality online courses, although only the following (on the three front-end web languages) are recommended for this module:
  - [Learn How to Build Websites](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/learn-how-to-build-websites)
  - [Introduction to **HTML**](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html)
  - [Learn **CSS**](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css)
  - [Introduction to **JavaScript**](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript).
- **[learn.freecodecamp.org](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/)**  
  A complete free front-end course, including responsive webapps.
- **[WatchAndCode.com: Practical Javascript](https://watchandcode.com/p/practical-javascript)**  
  A well-taught course on JavaScript.
- **[Udacity.com: Front End Web Developer](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0011)**  
  The above Udacity course is recommended for this module.

## Plagiarism

DMU defines plagiarism as **“the deliberate attempt to gain advantage by presenting any work, data or concepts (including drafts and work in progress) that are not the student’s own as if they were”**. The University takes a very serious stance against copying other people’s work without giving the proper credit.

You can read more about plagiarism and other acedemic offences in [Chapter 4 of the student regulations](https://www.dmu.ac.uk/documents/dmu-students/academic-support-office/student-regulations/chapter-4-17.18.pdf).

If you use somebody else’s work, either as research or directly, always attribute the author/artist/musician etc in the proper way. In this module we use the Harvard Referencing style. Directions on the use of the Harvard referencing system can be found through the [DMU library website](http://www.library.dmu.ac.uk/Images/Selfstudy/Harvard.pdf)

If you are found to of copied work without crediting the source you are likely to face a disciplinary panel and could see your mark reduced to 0, or worse in extreme cases.

If you have any questions regarding plagiarism and other academic practice offences, you can email either of the Leicester Media School's Academic Practice Officers:

- Simon Walsh <simon.walsh@dmu.ac.uk>
- Helen Ackerley <hackerley@dmu.ac.uk>

## Assessment

You will be assessed continuously through the module with formal feedback given at two key points through the year as well as informally in labs. The full details of coursework 1 and 2 follows this brief overview.

### Coursework 1

**Date and time due: 12pm (midday) on Friday 13th December 2019**

Worth **40%** of the module total, your first coursework will see you produce an individual piece of work. This will involve planning and designing a responsive website, this should include wireframe sketches, final designs including navigation, mood board, content inventory, testing from card-sorting in the labs and interaction design (what changes, how and why). You also need to explain how you will prepare media types and text content for web delivery.

### Coursework 2

**Date and time due: 12pm (midday) on Friday 3rd April 2020**

Worth **60%** of the module total, this coursework will tackle HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript ES6 to have you produce the website or web application you designed for coursework 1.

### Some notes on assessment submissions

All written submissions (i.e. reports and documentation) should be submitted through Turnitin. You will find a link to submit your report through the Assessment section on Blackboard.

You will be required to create a logical folder structure on your public server to which you will upload your practical work for marking. Follow the instructions for structure and naming exactly, and don’t put anything there that shouldn’t be marked. If your tutor is in any doubt as to where your work is, it may not get marked.

Make sure the names of all files on your public server are _lower-case only_, with letters, numbers, underscores and hyphens - no spaces, no slashes!

If you are unsure about any details of an assessment, ask your lab tutor.

To reiterate:

- **All written work through Turnitin**
- **All practical work uploaded to your public server space**
