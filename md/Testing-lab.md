# Testing and Validating Your Website

This is a little different to the usual labsheet - there are no steps to follow.

Instead, this is a list of tools for testing your website.

## W3 HTML Validator

<https://validator.w3.org>  
This will check that you have valid HTML i.e. that it properly conforms to what HTML should look like. This can also be handy for debugging your html.

## W3 CSS Validator

<https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/>  
As above, but for CSS

## Google Page Speed Insights

<https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/>  
Will run a test on your site and give you a report on its speed for both mobile and desktop, including suggestions for how to make it quicker.

## Google Lighthouse

Google's Lighthouse is a free tool that comes as part of the Dev Tools. It can perform a detailed technical analysis of any web page, and provide you with actionable recommendations for improving both the user experience and the search ranking of your site. Just open the Dev Tools in Chrome and go to the Lighthouse tab.

## Browserstack

<https://www.browserstack.com>  
Lets you run your site on a range of devices and browsers giving you a virtual window to interact with it.

## User Testing

Don't forget to also get feedback from real users. To collect that feedback, you could use:  
<https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk>  
<https://www.google.com/forms/about/>
