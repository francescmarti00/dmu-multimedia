# Using Atom

Atom is a coding-orientated text editor. We'll be using it to write code for the web.

## What is Atom?

Atom is really just a text editor, a computer application you can use to edit text files. This is all our code file are, text. We could use any text editor to work with them, but some have been designed with coding in mind and so they make a few things easier. Atom is one of those. There are others, such as VS Code or Sublime Text.

If you’ve got your own computer, you can download Atom from <https://atom.io>. If you’re on one of the lab machines it should be installed. Ask your lab tutor if you’re not sure how to find this and launch Atom.

The folks behind Atom have provided some great documentation that includes a getting started guide. You can find this at <http://flight-manual.atom.io>. Take a look if you want.

## Starting a Project

Whenever you start a new website, start with a folder. Your site will end up being made of lots of different types of file, so keep them all together in a folder. You can create a folder using Windows or MacOS as normal.

You'll then want to open that folder in Atom. With Atom open, go to `File -> Open Folder` (Windows) or `File -> Open` (Mac). Find your new folder and hit `Open`.

This will open up a new window with a project explorer on the left and the editor on the right.

## Managing Files

You can use Atom to create new HTML files. Just right-click on the folder you want to create it in, and select `New File`. Atom will ask you to provide the path - this is the location and file name. Just put the filename on the end, `index.html` for example. Don't forget to include the `.html`. This is the file extension. It tells the system, and Atom, what type of file this is.

You can also create folders in the same way. Folders don't have file extensions. You might want to create a folder to keep all your website's images in for example.

You can also delete and rename files from within Atom. Just right-click the file and select the appropriate option.

There's a lot more that Atom can do, but that should get you started.
