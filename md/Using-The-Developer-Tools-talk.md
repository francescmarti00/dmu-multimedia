# Using the Developer Tools

Google's Chrome browser (and others) comes with a handy set of developer tools that can help us to diagnose problems with our website.

## What are Developer Tools

The browser provides a set of tools that you can use to inspect your websites. Amongst other things, you can:

1. Navigate the elements of your page as the browser highlights them
2. Find out what style rules are being applied to each element
3. View a mobile version of your site
4. View a range of metrics to assess the efficiency of your site

## Opening Developer Tools

You've got three ways to open the tools:

1. Right-click anywhere on your page and select `Inspect`
2. Go to `View -> Developer -> Developer Tools`
3. Use the keyboard shortcut..

- Mac: `CMD + OPT + i`
- Windows: `CTRL + SHIFT + j` or `F12`

## Navigating Elements

The Elements tab shows you the browsers computed idea of your page's HTML structure. As you mouse over these elements, they are highlighted in the main browser window, along with their sizes. This can be handy for working out why the layout of your site doesn't look how you thought it might.

## Inspecting Style Rules

If you select one of the elements in the Elements tab, the right-hand side of the view shows you the style rules that are being applied, and where they've come from. It will also show you any rules that aren't being used because of a clash. This can help you understand why things look the way they do, and not how you intended.

## Viewing a Mobile Version

There's a little button near the top-right of the Developer Tools panel that looks like a phone in front of a tablet. Clicking this will switch you into mobile view, where you can simulate experiencing your site on a mobile device.

## Site Metrics

The Developer Tools panel has a number of tabs that will assess the performance of your site. Perhaps most useful of these is Lighthouse, a facility that will score your site against a range of criteria and give you ideas for improving things.
