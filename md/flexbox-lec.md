Flexbox works by defining two types of element

1. A container
2. Its items

These can be divs, navs, as, ps, imgs etc etc

---

## The Container

By default, a container is horizontal and lays its items out left to right.


## Some terminology

Main Axis: the main direction of item flow.
Cross Axis: perpendicular to the main axis.
Main Size: length/height along the main axis.
Cross Size: length/height along the cross axis.

We also have some set points - main start, main end, cross start, and cross end.


This terminology is the same whether the container is horizontal or vertical, left to right or right to left.
