# Refresher Tasks

### Designed to test your competency with HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript

In each case, you should create a new HTML file. Any CSS and JavaScript should be contained in the same file.

Feel free to make use of online resources to help you complete these tasks.

## 1.

Create a page that has a filled red square in the top left corner.

## 2.

## 5.

Create a page that mimics the Danish flag, filling the page, and so that it resizes as the browser window changes size.
(bonus points: do the same but for the Icelandic flag)

[webM version](https://thomcorah.github.io/dmu-multimedia/resources/vid/vidSample.webm)  
[ogg version](https://thomcorah.github.io/dmu-multimedia/resources/vid/vidSample.ogv)

## 7.

Create a page with a blue square that:

- turns red when the mouse hovers over it
- turns back to blue when the mouse is no longer over it
- transitions both changes over 0.3 seconds

**Note: These last three use JavaScript. Attempt if you want, don't feel bad if you're totally stuck.**

## 8.

Create a page with a box with a 0 in it. Every second, the number in the box goes up by 1.

## 9.

Create a page with a green square that starts off in the top left corner but moves 50 pixels to the right every time it's clicked.  
(Bonus points: start the square in the middle of the page and move it in a random direction with each click)

## 10.

Create a page with a blue square and a red square. Clicking on either square swaps their colours.
