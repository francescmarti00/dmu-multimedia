## Remember this?


## Problems when viewing on a small screen

(if you try to push a site designed for desktop)

* Layouts get cramped  
* The automatic flow of things can break a layout  
* Images are larger than necessary  
* Images take too long to download  
* Images bleed off the   
* User's information priority may be different  


## How do we fix all of this?

1. Set the viewport
2. Size content to the viewport
3. Use relative units
4. Use CSS media queries
