#Â Starting a Project

### 1. Create a folder, open it in Atom.
Use the normal windows explorer to create the folder. Open it in Atom using File -> Open Folder.. if you're on Windows, or just File -> Open.. if you're on a Mac.

### 2. Create a `css` folder, and create a `style.css` file inside it.
You can do this in Atom. Right click your new project folder in Atom and select New Folder. Put a name in the box. Right click the new folder and select New File. Don't forget the .css file extension on the new file.

### 3. Create your `html` file.
Right click your main project folder in Atom and select New File. Don't forget the .html file extension.

### 4. Fill it with the starting HTML
In your new html file, type `html` and hit the Tab key.

### 5. Add the viewport meta tag to the `<head>` section:
This is it:
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
```

### 6. Link the stylesheet in.
Use a `<link>` element in the `<head>` section. There's a short guide to inserting a stylesheet here: <https://thomcorah.github.io/dmu-multimedia/lab-reader.html?linking-a-css-file-short.md>

### 7. Open your page in Chrome
Do so through the browser. Navigate to <https://my.tech.dmu.ac.uk/~pNumber> and substitute your own student number in.

### 8. Open the inspector and switch to responsive mode.
Right click anywhere in the Chrome window and select Inspect to open the developer tools. Then click the little logo that looks like a phone and a tablet to switch to responsive mode.
