# Team Challenge

This team challenge is all about HTML and CSS. You are to recreate, as far as you can, the mobile view for the DMU website - <https://dmu.ac.uk>  

There are a number of things to watch out for here:

* It uses a background image behind the main headline content. Additionally, this image remains fixed as the page scrolls over it. Tricky.
* Text content in that main headline section is centred.
* The content boxes have rounded corners, except at the join between the image and the label underneath.

You can right-click and save the images off the actual website for use here, you don't need to make new ones.

The site also has a video behind the main headline, but only go for that if you're feeling really adventurous. Or perhaps, don't bother!

There is a menu button and a search button in the top-right that do things when touched. Don't worry about these doing things. We just want the visuals.

Good luck.
