# Principles of UI Design
1. Structure
2. Simplicity
3. Visibility
4. Feedback
5. Tolerance
6. Reuse


# Structure
* The layout and look of your UI  
* It should make sense to the user  
* Put related things together  
* Make things that are unrelated different  


# Simplicity
* Do not overcomplicate things  
* What is the user trying to do?  
* Just do this.  


# Visibility
* Just show the user what they're likely to need  
* Make common tasks visible   
* Don't overwhelm     


# Feedback  
* Keep the user informed  
* Language should be familiar and unambiguous  
* The user should know where they are  


# Tolerance  
* Allow for errors   
* Reduce the likelihood of errors  


# Reuse
* Maintain consistency with purpose  
* Reuse components and behaviours  
* Internal and external

# Some Examples

notes:  
Photoshop  
- note the grouping of controls and reuse of ui areas  

Medium <https://medium.com>  
- indication of time  
- reuse of post format  
- visibility in a story focussed on reading  
- reuse of external ideas  
  - logo in top right links home
  - pointer changes when hovered over active things
  - links change colour on hover

Google  
- same things  

DMU site  
- lots of information, mostly in menus - visibility, Simplicity

# What about mobile?

We have some particular challenges on mobile
1. Smaller screen <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
2. Touch interface <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
3. Limited data allowance <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
4. Limited bandwidth <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
5. Used on the move <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


# What does this mean?

1. Don't cram <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
2. Make buttons touchable <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
3. No hover <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
4. Keep images, video, audio, small and necessary <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
5. Consider information priority <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


# Relating to those Principles


**1. Structure**  

Narrow screen leads to single column design.  
Make sure your spacing and style groups items


**2. Simplicity**   

Especially important - limited screen space and bandwidth


**3. Visibility**    

Their needs might be different  
Map - phone number - link to apps


**4. Feedback**   

Users are used to apps with fluid navigation  
Screen space more limited for notifications  


**5. Tolerance**  

Becomes more important because:
* Small touch keyboard  
* Autocorrect  


**6. Reuse**  
Well, this is the same really.
