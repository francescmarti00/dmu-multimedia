# Principles of UI Design

1. Structure
2. Simplicity
3. Visibility
4. Feedback
5. Tolerance
6. Reuse

# Structure

- The layout and look of your UI
- It should make sense to the user
- Put related things together
- Make things that are unrelated different

# Simplicity

- Do not overcomplicate things
- What is the user trying to do?
- Just do this.

# Visibility

- Just show the user what they're likely to need
- Make common tasks visible
- Don't overwhelm

# Feedback

- Keep the user informed
- Language should be familiar and unambiguous
- The user should know where they are

# Tolerance

- Allow for errors
- Reduce the likelihood of errors

# Reuse

- Maintain consistency with purpose
- Reuse components and behaviours
- Internal and external

# Some Examples

Photoshop

- note the grouping of controls and reuse of ui areas

Medium <https://medium.com>

- indication of time
- reuse of post format
- visibility in a story focussed on reading
- reuse of external ideas
  - logo in top right links home
  - pointer changes when hovered over active things
  - links change colour on hover

DMU site

- lots of information, mostly in menus - visibility, simplicity

# What about mobile?

We have some particular challenges on mobile

1. Smaller screen
2. Touch interface
3. Limited data allowance
4. Limited bandwidth
5. Used on the move

# What does this mean?

1. Don't cram
2. Make buttons touchable
3. No hover
4. Keep images, video, audio, small and necessary
5. Consider information priority

# Relating to those Principles

**1. Structure**

Narrow screen leads to single column design.  
Make sure your spacing and style groups items

**2. Simplicity**

Especially important - limited screen space and bandwidth

**3. Visibility**

Their needs might be different  
Map - phone number - link to apps

**4. Feedback**

Users are used to apps with fluid navigation  
Screen space more limited for notifications

**5. Tolerance**

Becomes more important because:

- Small touch keyboard
- Autocorrect

**6. Reuse**  
Well, this is the same really.

# Too Much To Remember?

**R** epetition  
**A** lignment  
**P** roximity
