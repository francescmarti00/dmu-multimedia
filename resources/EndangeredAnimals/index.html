        <h1>Amur Leopard</h1>
        <p>
          People usually think of leopards in the savannas of Africa but in the
          Russian Far East, a rare subspecies has adapted to life in the
          temperate forests that make up the northern-most part of the species’
          range. Similar to other leopards, the Amur leopard can run at speeds
          of up to 37 miles per hour. This incredible animal has been reported
          to leap more than 19 feet horizontally and up to 10 feet vertically.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Amur leopard is solitary. Nimble-footed and strong, it carries and
          hides unfinished kills so that they are not taken by other predators.
          It has been reported that some males stay with females after mating,
          and may even help with rearing the young. Several males sometimes
          follow and fight over a female. They live for 10-15 years, and in
          captivity up to 20 years. The Amur leopard is also known as the Far
          East leopard, the Manchurian leopard or the Korean leopard.

        <h1>Cross River Gorilla</h1>
        <p>
          This subspecies of the western gorilla is very similar in appearance
          to the more numerous western lowland gorilla, but subtle differences
          can be found in the skull and tooth dimensions. Cross River gorillas
          live in a region populated by many humans who have encroached upon the
          gorilla’s territory—clearing forests for timber and to create fields
          for agriculture and livestock. Poaching occurs in the forests as well,
          and the loss of even a few of these gorillas has a detrimental effect
          on such a small population.
        </p>
        <img src="img/Gorilla.jpg" alt="cross river gorilla" />
        <p>
          Efforts to protect these animals are focused on securing the forests
          that house them. WWF and partners have worked with the governments of
          Cameroon and Nigeria to create a protected area for the Cross River
          gorilla that spans the border of these two nations.

        <h1>Bornean Orangutan</h1>
        <p>
          Bornean orangutan populations have declined by more than 50% over the
          past 60 years, and the species' habitat has been reduced by at least
          55% over the past 20 years.
        </p>
        <img src="img/Orangutan.jpg" alt="Bornean Orangutan" />
        <p>
          The Bornean orangutan differs in appearance from the Sumatran
          orangutan, with a broader face and shorter beard and also slightly
          darker in color. Three subspecies are recognized, each localized to
          different parts of the island:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Northwest Bornean orangutans are the most threatened subspecies. Its
            habitat has been seriously affected by logging and hunting, and a
            mere 1,500 individuals or so remain. Many habitat patches in the
            area are small and fragmented.
          </li>
          <li>
            Northeast Bornean orangutans are the smallest in size and found in
            Sabah and eastern Kalimantan as far as the Mahakam River.
          </li>
          <li>
            Central Bornean orangutans are the subspecies with the most animals,
            with at least 35,000 individuals.
          </li>

        <h1>Black Rhino</h1>
        <p>
          Black rhinos are the smaller of the two African rhino species. The
          most notable difference between white and black rhinos are their
          hooked upper lip. This distinguishes them from the white rhino, which
          has a square lip. Black rhinos are browsers rather than grazers, and
          their pointed lip helps them feed on leaves from bushes and trees.
          They have two horns, and occasionally a third, small posterior horn.
        </p>
        <img src="img/Rhino.jpg" alt="Black Rhino" />
        <p>
          Populations of black rhino declined dramatically in the 20th century
          at the hands of European hunters and settlers. Between 1960 and 1995,
          black rhino numbers dropped by a sobering 98%, to less than 2,500.
          Since then, the species has made a tremendous comeback from the brink
          of extinction. Thanks to persistent conservation efforts across
          Africa, black rhino numbers have doubled from their historic low 20
          years ago to around 5,600 today. However, the black rhino is still
          considered critically endangered, and a lot of work remains to bring
          the numbers up to even a fraction of what it once was—and to ensure
          that it stays there. Wildlife crime—in this case, poaching and
          black-market trafficking of rhino horn—continues to plague the species
          and threaten its recovery.

        <h1>Sunda Tiger</h1>
        <p>
          Sunda tigers are distinguished by heavy black stripes on their orange
          coats. The last of the Sunda island tigers—estimated to be fewer than
          400 today—are holding on for survival in the remaining patches of
          forest on the island of Sumatra. Accelerating deforestation and
          rampant poaching mean this noble creature could end up extinct like
          its Javan and Balinese counterparts.
        </p>
        <img src="img/Tiger.jpg" alt="Sunda Tiger" />
        <p>
          In Indonesia, anyone caught hunting tigers could face jail time and
          steep fines. But despite increased efforts in tiger
          conservation—including strengthening law enforcement and antipoaching
          capacity—a substantial market remains in Sumatra and other parts of
          Asia for tiger parts and products. Sunda tigers are losing their
          habitat and prey fast, and poaching is an ever-present threat.
