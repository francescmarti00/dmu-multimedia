      <h1>Single Column</h1>
      <p>
        This is a nicely centred column, designed to create a more pleasing
        reading experience on a wide desktop computer. It's not nice to have to
        read a really long line and then find the start of the next one, so a
        narrower column of text makes things nicer.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, our good intentions can work against us if we set this column
        up with a fixed width, as that fixed width might be larger than the
        width of a mobile screen! Given that so many people view the web on
        their mobile, we should really make sure they can read what we write!
