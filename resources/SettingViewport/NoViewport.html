    <h1>The Viewport has not been set</h1>
    <p>
      This is a webpage where the viewport has not been set to tell that browser
      that it should be displayed appropriately on mobile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consequently, the browser has created a 'fake' window with a width of
      about 960 pixels, drawn this webpage in it, and then shrunk it all down to
      fit in the actual window of the mobile device.
