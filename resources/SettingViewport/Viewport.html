    <h1>The Viewport has been set</h1>
    <p>
      Browsers create a 'fake' window that they draw a website into before
      displaying it. This is called the viewport.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a webpage where the width of the viewport has been set to be the
      same width as the device's screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consequently, the elements are the correct size for the device.
