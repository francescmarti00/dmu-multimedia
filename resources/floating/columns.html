        <p>
          An adorable, small dog with the personality of a big clown, the
          Cockapoo is the first of the “designer dogs” (not a “pure” dog breed),
          dating back to the 1960s, rather than to just a few years ago.
          Completely people-oriented, the Cockapoo is intelligent enough to
          train easily, hardly sheds, forgives quickly, and is so affectionate
          that you’ll never feel alone. Read more

          door for a minute of privacy. They’re happy running around an agility
          course, showing off their tricks to company, being petted as a therapy
          dog, or just hanging out on your lap. Your lap is theirs, by the way.
