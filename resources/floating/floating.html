        An adorable, small dog with the personality of a big clown, the Cockapoo
        is the first of the “designer dogs” (not a “pure” dog breed), dating
        back to the 1960s, rather than to just a few years ago. Completely
        people-oriented, the Cockapoo is intelligent enough to train easily,
        hardly sheds, forgives quickly, and is so affectionate that you’ll never
        feel alone. You might even have to shut the bathroom door for a minute
        of privacy. They’re happy running around an agility course, showing off
        their tricks to company, being petted as a therapy dog, or just hanging
        out on your lap. Your lap is theirs, by the way. Read more
