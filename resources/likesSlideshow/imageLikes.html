         a filled in heart. So, to switch from one to the other we add the fas
         classname on the end of the classlist.

         We can use this to check if an image has been liked - look to see
         if the classlist contains the fas class.

         element that was clicked (the target of the event) and checks if it has
         the fas class. If it does have it, it removes it.

         If it doesn't have it, it adds it, but then goes on to add 1 to the
         like count for this image. In real life, we'd have multiple users, and
         so the like count would be incremented by 1 when we like an image, and
         decremented by 1 if we unlike it. However, for this dummy system we want
