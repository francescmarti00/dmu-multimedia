        <img src="img/boulder.jpg" alt="Boulder being dropped in the sea" />
        <p>
          To stop destructive bottom trawlers from operating in the Offshore
          Brighton Marine Protected Area we needed to create a physical barrier,
          for this we turned to natural materials in the form of granite
          boulders. We chose granite because it’s an inert material and won’t
          react with the water at the seabed.
