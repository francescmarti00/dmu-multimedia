        <h1>Amazon Deforestation</h1>
      </header>

      <section>
        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          The Amazon is the world’s largest rainforest and the largest river
          basin on the planet. More species are found here than anywhere else.
        </p>

        <p>
          The region is believed to be home to 10% – 1 in 10 – known species on
          Earth. Of plant species found in this region, 75% are unique to the
          Amazon, and there are 3,000 species of fish, the largest number of
          freshwater fish species in the world.
        </p>

        <p>
          Today, the Amazon is facing a multitude of threats as a result of
          unsustainable economic development; 20% of the Amazon biome has
          already been lost and the trend will worsen if gone unchecked.
        </p>
        <p>
          WWF estimates that 27 per cent – more than a quarter – of the Amazon
          biome will be without trees by 2030 if the current rate of
          deforestation continues.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>Trends and Causes</h1>
        <p>
          Deforestation rates in the Amazon have declined over the last decade,
          but continue at an alarming rate. Brazil is responsible for half of
          the deforestation in the Amazon, but deforestation in the Andean
          Amazon countries – namely Bolivia and Peru – is increasing.
          Deforestation is concentrated in particular in 25 “sub-fronts” that
          span across multiple countries.
        </p>

        <p>
          The areas showing the greatest deforestation rates are those that have
          more roads. The strong correlation between the location of
          deforestation fronts and the presence of existing roads or projections
          of new roads suggests that in the near future there will be isolated
          deforestation fronts becoming connected along major infrastructure
          development routes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other factors exacerbating pressure in the region include an increase
          in cattle ranching and soy plantations, particularly in Bolivia; the
          South American energy and transport integration that was started with
          banks and a group of governments; and hydropower dams.
