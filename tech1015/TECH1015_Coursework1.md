###Overview
Coursework 1 is an individual piece of web work that will see you demonstrate knowledge and use of the core principles of media presentation through the web. To this end, you will create a two page website showcasing a film. This will include imagery, audio and video content, as well as a simple style. Alongside the practical work, you will also submit documentation that provides an overview of the production process and evaluates your finished work.

**All written work must be submitted through the Turnitin link on Blackboard**

The submission deadline for this work is midday on Friday 13th December. You are encouraged to seek feedback from your lab tutor throughout the first semester on your ongoing work. To this end, the lab session in the week before submission is entirely given over to completion of this work. You may have the opportunity in earlier lab sessions to complete work towards this assignment should you finish the prescribed task for that session early, though don’t rely on this. 

Coursework 1 is worth 40% of your module mark.

###The Task

You are to produce a two page website for an upcoming film. Which film this is remains up to you. It can be new, old, made up. From the viewers’ point of view, several things should be included:

* A trailer for the film  
	- so you’ll need to include video  
* At least one audio interview  
	- so you’ll need to include audio  
* Images of key cast  
	- so you’ll need some images in there  
* A synopsis of the film  
	- so you’ve got some text content  

Your website will be across two pages. The first page will include the synopsis and trailer. The second page will have cast pictures and audio interviews. 

You don’t need to include the real trailer, or real interviews with the task, but they do need to be actual video and audio files. You’re being marked on how you include these, not the quality of the media itself. 

There is a prescribed layout for each of the two pages. You should use CSS to attempt to achieve these layouts. The fonts, colours, and other embellishments are up to you.

![Required Website Layout](https://www.dropbox.com/s/141m48lm8t7ungv/TECH1015%20CW1%20Layout.png?raw=1)

While you can add to this for better visual clarity, such as by boxing up each row of cast information and adding more rows, you should maintain as much of this layout as possible. The menu will only have two options in it, one for each page. The footer should have something suitably generic, such as a copyright notice for example.

You should pay close attention to the marking criteria below for the specific points you will be marked on. 

If you’re at all unsure about what you are meant to do, ask your lab tutor for guidance.

###The Documentation

You are also to produce documentation alongside this. This has two main aims. Firstly, you should provide an overview of your production process including the reason for making the choices you have. For example, how did you lay out the cast rows and why did you choose that method. We want to see two things here, that you understand what you’ve done, and that you’ve put some thought into possible approaches. Screenshots and code snippets are useful here for helping to show what you’re talking about. 

The second part of your documentation is the evaluation. This should include feedback from peers. You’ll see from the marking criteria that you’ll lose marks if you don’t include this. Ideally, you’ll have a range of people try out your website and then provide structured feedback on it. You might want to create a questionnaire that has a few questions soliciting a numerical answer (quality of design between 1 and 5, clarity of content etc) and then a couple of opportunities for the user to provide some more text-based feedback. You should then include this data in your report, and very importantly, comment on it. 

You should then go on to form your own critical opinion of your work, building in reflection on your peer feedback. You need to be able to stand back from your work and be objective about it. This is crucial. What works about your site, what doesn’t. What did you find difficult, or what did you fail to achieve. Be completely honest. You wont lose any marks for pointing out something that doesn’t work. Indeed, you’ll gain marks for having a good critical approach. 

Again, ask your lab tutor if you are at all unsure about what you should be writing.

###Submission

Your work should be submitted in two places, before midday on Friday 13th December.

####Turnitin
Turnitin is a facility that allows for the submission of documentation and includes a similarity checker to ensure your work is original. Your report should be submitted through the Turnitin link available on the module Blackboard shell. You'll find it in the Assessments section.

####public_html
In order to be able to view your website through a web server, you should transfer your website to your `public_html` folder, uncompressed, with its complete folder structure intact. On doing so, you should view your website through the server to ensure that all links and media still work.   
**Do not make any changes after the deadline**

###Marking Criteria

There are two components here, the website and the documentation, so each is marked separately.   

####Website  
The website makes up 70% of your mark. You have to demonstrate a number of principles. You will receive a mark for each depending on the degree to which you successfully achieve this. They are:

**Include Images**  
Full marks for at least three images included using the `<img>` element, with suitable alt text, and originals that are close to the final display size of the image.

**Include Audio**  
Full marks for the inclusion of audio using the `<audio>` element with at least two different file formats properly used. 

**Include Video**  
Full marks for the inclusion of video using the `<video>` element, with at least two different file formats properly used and a poster image in place. 

**Separate Style Sheet**  
Full marks for using a single .css file that uses properly formed CSS and linking it to both pages of the website.

**Well Formed and Appropriate Markup**  
Full marks for a site that has properly written HTML and makes full use of HTML semantic elements such as `nav`.

**Interlinking**  
Full marks for both successfully linking the two pages together, and providing links to external pages i.e. other website(s).

**Layout Implementation**  
Full marks for using CSS to successfully achieve the given layout. 

For each of these seven criteria you will receive a mark out of 10, giving you a total out of 70.

###Documentation  
The documentation is worth 30% of the coursework grade. You will be marked against three criteria, again with a mark out of 10 for each one:

**Justification of Choices**  
Your documentation should provide an overview of the production process, including justification for your approach to problems and the solutions you used. 

**Consideration of Third-Party Feedback**  
You should seek opinion from others on the quality of your work and reflect on this. Have a handful of people use your site and complete a short questionnaire for example. Include the results, but then go on to discuss them.

**Quality of Self-Evaluation**  
A good evaluation will demonstrate an ability to stand back from your work and critically evaluate it. What worked, what didn’t, and what could be improved.
