Work submitted unauthorised more than 14 calendar days after the original submission date will receive a mark of 0%.  These regulations apply to a student’s first attempt at coursework. Work submitted late without authorisation which constitutes reassessment of a previously failed piece of coursework will always receive a mark of 0%.”

###Overview
In semester 1 you produced an individual piece of web work. For this coursework you will produce a full website or web-based application. 

The actual website or application you produce is up to you. You are encouraged to develop something that you will find personally interesting. Some examples include:

* A portfolio website showcasing a range of creative work (audio, video, photography…)  
* A website for a band that includes discography, live dates, and streams music from their latest release  
* A website for a film that includes a trailer as well as interviews with the cast and a countdown to release  
* A digital story that allows the reader to follow a range of paths through the narrative, incorporating graphics, audio, and video  
* An online music video for a song that uses multiple windows as the song progresses  
* A simple web-based game  

Some key points to consider include:

* The stylistic design of the site including colour and font choices.  
* The use of text copy   
* The inclusion of social media options for sharing  
* The usability and accessibility of the website   
* Your target audience and what this means for the site design  
* Use of graphics, audio, animation and video  
* Demonstration of the techniques covered in the module  


The content should be your own.  All content that is not yours (images, music, sound effects, etc.) should be appropriately referenced at a minimum in a list in the documentation (note that Google, or other search engines are not sources of information). Failure to do so is plagiarism and may attract a zero grade. This does not prevent you from getting your colleagues or tutor to criticise early drafts of your work before it is handed in / published.

Any content you produce for your website such as an audio interview will be marked primarily on its suitability for web deployment rather than its own production value. For example, a video that is stored at a much larger size than it is displayed at would be a no no. You have other modules where you are keenly assessed on the production value of your digital output. Speak to your tutor if you have any questions about this.

There are two main components to this coursework: the website itself and a portfolio of associated documentation. The website attracts 60% of the mark for this coursework, and the documentation 40%.

###Documentation.
**Weighting:** 40% of the coursework mark, broken down as follows.

Your documentation should consist of the following components. 

####Proposal and Initial Designs
**Weighting:** 10% of the coursework mark 
 
This should give an outline of your intended website, including:

* Description that includes an outline of your idea  
* Target audience and possible ramifications for the site design  
* Discussion on the technical challenges your idea poses  
* Initial basic designs for layout and site structure  


####Production  
**Weighting:** 10% of the coursework mark

This should give some insight into the development of your website. Pick three individual components and discuss:

* What you were trying to achieve
* How you did this
* Why you chose the approach you did
* How successful the approach was

Examples of what is meant here by an individual component of your website include a slideshow, a dropdown menu, an accordian display, an animated transition between pages and so on. 

####Evaluation
**Weighting:** 20% of the coursework mark  

You should address the following points:

* Provide evidence of testing (e.g. all links work, media loads, the site is consistent across browsers).  
* Provide evidence and a breakdown of structured user testing and feedback.  
* Evaluate your work, with reference to testing where appropriate, and user feedback, describing:  
	* Your achievements, refer back to the original aims, explain any changes to your original ideas and why or how they have happened.  
	* Any limitations of your web site  
	* Any improvements you would make to the site and why  
	* Any problems you encountered along the way, with potential solutions where possible  


Your complete documentation should be submitted through the Turnitin link on Blackboard no later than midday on Friday 3rd April.

###Web Site
**Weighting:** 60% of the coursework mark, broken down as follows.

Your site should be accessible via your `public_html` folder. It should be located at `public_html > TECH1015 > coursework1 > production`.

The website will be assessed on the following three points.

####Content 
**Weighting:** 15% of the coursework mark  
Your website content should be fit for purpose and appropriate. This includes all text, graphics, images, sounds, and videos. You should use the correct techniques for displaying these in modern web browsers and ensure that you are using disk space and bandwidth efficiently. 

* Text content shows semantic structure e.g. headings, lists  
* Careful selection, creation and editing of video and/or audio  
* Awareness of loading speed and disk space e.g. no huge images  
* Original content is credited and third-party content is referenced  


####Style 
**Weighting:** 15% of the coursework mark  
Your website should appeal to your intended audience and be consistent with your storyboards / designs. You should make appropriate use of CSS in order to properly style and layout your site. 

* Style and layout reflect/have evolved from proposal  
* Coherent overall design, colour and font choices  
* Design and content matches the target audience  
* Skilful use of CSS to style and arrange site elements   

####Technical Skills 
**Weighting:** 30% of the coursework mark  
Your web site should contain a variety of appropriate techniques that demonstrate your ability to apply the concepts you have learnt in this module. 

* Evidence of intelligent ability to choose and code current website techniques 
* Awareness of usability/accessibility (semantic HTML5 tags and image “alt” attributes) 
* Use of CSS animations and transitions  
* All links work, media loads, site is consistent across browsers
