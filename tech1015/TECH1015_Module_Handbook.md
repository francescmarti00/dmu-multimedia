##Welcome to Multimedia I
I hope you enjoy studying this module through your first year and find that you learn many valuable skills from it. It is a modern reality that many creative disciplines can be enhanced with at least a working knowledge of how the web works. An incredible amount of content is now delivered over the Internet, from short form videos to full blockbusters, from amateur audio clips to professional albums, images, radio, applications and more. Whether you’re a videographer, sound engineer, animator or editor, an understanding of the web should be a key component of your skillset. 

Throughout the module please get in touch if you have anything to say on the content or the way we teach it. We’re very open to comments, good and bad, that will help to shape and improve the module. Similarly, if you’re having problems keeping up or don’t understand a particular concept, please get in touch as soon as possible and we’ll be able to help you more easily. 

Some of you may of created websites with HTML before and some won’t. For those that haven’t, don’t worry. We start from the very beginning and build things up at a pace that you can deal with. If you would like extra help, get in touch.

##Module Description

This module will launch you into the world of presenting interesting and interactive media. The ability to be able to turn ideas into digital realities is becoming increasingly important in a range of industries, and so this module will seek to equip you with some fundamental skills in HTML authoring and online interactivity. We take a look at creating styled webpages with the languages of HTML and CSS, before dipping a toe into the language of Javascript to add a little more oomph to the page. 

An initial run of lectures will lay some theoretical groundwork for what is to come. Practical skills will be developed through hands-on learning and practice at the workstation, supported by experienced lab tutors and live demonstrations. 

Throughout the module you are encouraged to undertake your own research into the software and practices we undertake. You should develop the ability to solve problems encountered in your work in an independent fashion, though your lab tutor will step in if necessary.

<a name='outcomes'></a>
##Learning Outcomes

At the end of the module, you will be able to:

* Develop a standalone web-site incorporating animated and dynamic content.  
* Use a range of sources in order to help solve technical problems related to basic web authoring and evaluate the results of your efforts in an objective manner.  
* Understand issues related to browser platforms, accessibility and usability when displaying dynamic and animated content on the Web.  
* Gather, analyse, and present data to assist with the evaluation of your work.  
* Develop a basic understanding of the languages of the web, HTML, CSS and JavaScript

<a name='topics'></a>
##Key Topics

This module will cover the basics of media presentation through the web using HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript. This list gives you an indication of the topics we will be exploring over the course of the year:

* Key digital literacy, establishing good practices for file management and data presentation
* User interfaces in terms of aesthetics, accessibility, and usability.
* HTML elements, building a webpage with meaning
* Visual styling of a webpage
* Webpage layout
* Embedding audio and video content
* Working with fonts
* User interface animations
* Manipulating what's on the page with JavaScript

There is some flexibility with what we cover. As we progress through the year, if there's any topic you would like covered in more detail, or a different topic introduced, please email the module tutor or discuss this in labs.

##Blackboard – Virtual Learning Environment

This module makes use of Blackboard – De Montfort University’s Virtual Learning Environment. It is important that you access Blackboard regularly to keep up to date with:

* Assessments
* Lab activities
* Lecture notes
* Your assessment feedback
* General notices and announcements
* Lecture recordings 

Access to Blackboard can be found at:

<a name="plagiarism"></a>
##Plagiarism

DMU defines plagiarism as “the deliberate attempt to gain advantage by presenting any work, data or concepts (including drafts and work in progress) that are not the student’s own as if they were”. The University takes a very serious stance against copying other people’s work without giving the proper credit. 

You can read more about plagiarism and other acedemic offences in Chapter 4 of the student regulations: <https://www.dmu.ac.uk/documents/dmu-students/academic-support-office/student-regulations/chapter-4-17.18.pdf>

If you use somebody else’s work, either as research or directly, always attribute the author/artist/musician etc in the proper way. In this module we use the Harvard Referencing style. Directions on the use of the Harvard referencing system can be found through the library website: <http://www.library.dmu.ac.uk/Images/Selfstudy/Harvard.pdf>

If you are found to of copied work without crediting the source you are likely to face a disciplinary panel and could see your mark reduced to 0, or worse in extreme cases.

If you have any questions regarding plagiarism and other academic practice offences, you can email the Leicester Media School's Academic Practice Officer, Simon Walsh, on <simon.walsh@dmu.ac.uk>.

<a name='assessment'></a>
##Assessment

You will be assessed continuously through the module with formal feedback given at two key points through the year as well as informally in labs. The full details of coursework 1 and 2 follows this brief overview. 

###Coursework 1  
Worth 40% of the module total, your first coursework is an individual task. It will test the core skills learnt through much of the first semester seeing you produce a simple two-page website. Due in at the end of week 11, it’ll give you a chance to reflect what you have learnt so far before heading into Coursework 2.

###Coursework 2  
Worth 60% of the module total this coursework will tackle more advanced web technologies to have you produce a simple website from scratch. This coursework is much more open-ended: you choose what you're making, so there's plenty of scope to try out things that interest you. This is due in at the end of week 27, the last day before the Easter break.

###Some notes on assessment submissions

All written submissions (i.e. reports and documentation) should be submitted through Turnitin. You will find a link to submit your report through the Assessment section on Blackboard.

You will be required to create a logical folder structure on your public server to which you will upload your practical work for marking. Follow the instructions for structure and naming exactly, and don’t put anything there that shouldn’t be marked. If your tutor is in any doubt as to where your work is, it may not get marked. 

Make sure the names of all files on your public server include only letters, numbers, underscores and hyphens. No spaces, no slashes! 

If you are unsure about any details of an assessment, ask your lab tutor.

To reiterate:

All written work through Turnitin  
All practical work uploaded to your public server space

###Overview
Coursework 1 is an individual piece of web work that will see you demonstrate knowledge and use of the core principles of media presentation through the web. To this end, you will create a two page website showcasing a film. This will include imagery, audio and video content, as well as a simple style. Alongside the practical work, you will also submit documentation that provides an overview of the production process and evaluates your finished work.

**All written work must be submitted through the Turnitin link on Blackboard**

The submission deadline for this work is midday on Friday 13th December. You are encouraged to seek feedback from your lab tutor throughout the first semester on your ongoing work. To this end, the lab session in the week before submission is entirely given over to completion of this work. You may have the opportunity in earlier lab sessions to complete work towards this assignment should you finish the prescribed task for that session early, though don’t rely on this. 

Coursework 1 is worth 40% of your module mark.

###The Task

You are to produce a two page website for an upcoming film. Which film this is remains up to you. It can be new, old, made up. From the viewers’ point of view, several things should be included:

* A trailer for the film  
	- so you’ll need to include video  
* At least one audio interview  
	- so you’ll need to include audio  
* Images of key cast  
	- so you’ll need some images in there  
* A synopsis of the film  
	- so you’ve got some text content  

Your website will be across two pages. The first page will include the synopsis and trailer. The second page will have cast pictures and audio interviews. 

You don’t need to include the real trailer, or real interviews with the task, but they do need to be actual video and audio files. You’re being marked on how you include these, not the quality of the media itself. 

There is a prescribed layout for each of the two pages. You should use CSS to attempt to achieve these layouts. The fonts, colours, and other embellishments are up to you.

![Required Website Layout](https://www.dropbox.com/s/141m48lm8t7ungv/TECH1015%20CW1%20Layout.png?raw=1)

While you can add to this for better visual clarity, such as by boxing up each row of cast information and adding more rows, you should maintain as much of this layout as possible. The menu will only have two options in it, one for each page. The footer should have something suitably generic, such as a copyright notice for example.

You should pay close attention to the marking criteria below for the specific points you will be marked on. 

If you’re at all unsure about what you are meant to do, ask your lab tutor for guidance.

###The Documentation

You are also to produce documentation alongside this. This has two main aims. Firstly, you should provide an overview of your production process including the reason for making the choices you have. For example, how did you lay out the cast rows and why did you choose that method. We want to see two things here, that you understand what you’ve done, and that you’ve put some thought into possible approaches. Screenshots and code snippets are useful here for helping to show what you’re talking about. 

The second part of your documentation is the evaluation. This should include feedback from peers. You’ll see from the marking criteria that you’ll lose marks if you don’t include this. Ideally, you’ll have a range of people try out your website and then provide structured feedback on it. You might want to create a questionnaire that has a few questions soliciting a numerical answer (quality of design between 1 and 5, clarity of content etc) and then a couple of opportunities for the user to provide some more text-based feedback. You should then include this data in your report, and very importantly, comment on it. 

You should then go on to form your own critical opinion of your work, building in reflection on your peer feedback. You need to be able to stand back from your work and be objective about it. This is crucial. What works about your site, what doesn’t. What did you find difficult, or what did you fail to achieve. Be completely honest. You wont lose any marks for pointing out something that doesn’t work. Indeed, you’ll gain marks for having a good critical approach. 

Again, ask your lab tutor if you are at all unsure about what you should be writing.

###Submission

Your work should be submitted in two places, before midday on Friday 13th December.

####Turnitin
Turnitin is a facility that allows for the submission of documentation and includes a similarity checker to ensure your work is original. Your report should be submitted through the Turnitin link available on the module Blackboard shell. You'll find it in the Assessments section.

####public_html
In order to be able to view your website through a web server, you should transfer your website to your `public_html` folder, uncompressed, with its complete folder structure intact. On doing so, you should view your website through the server to ensure that all links and media still work.   
**Do not make any changes after the deadline**

###Marking Criteria

There are two components here, the website and the documentation, so each is marked separately.   

####Website  
The website makes up 70% of your mark. You have to demonstrate a number of principles. You will receive a mark for each depending on the degree to which you successfully achieve this. They are:

**Include Images**  
Full marks for at least three images included using the `<img>` element, with suitable alt text, and originals that are close to the final display size of the image.

**Include Audio**  
Full marks for the inclusion of audio using the `<audio>` element with at least two different file formats properly used. 

**Include Video**  
Full marks for the inclusion of video using the `<video>` element, with at least two different file formats properly used and a poster image in place. 

**Separate Style Sheet**  
Full marks for using a single .css file that uses properly formed CSS and linking it to both pages of the website.

**Well Formed and Appropriate Markup**  
Full marks for a site that has properly written HTML and makes full use of HTML semantic elements such as `nav`.

**Interlinking**  
Full marks for both successfully linking the two pages together, and providing links to external pages i.e. other website(s).

**Layout Implementation**  
Full marks for using CSS to successfully achieve the given layout. 

For each of these seven criteria you will receive a mark out of 10, giving you a total out of 70.

###Documentation  
The documentation is worth 30% of the coursework grade. You will be marked against three criteria, again with a mark out of 10 for each one:

**Justification of Choices**  
Your documentation should provide an overview of the production process, including justification for your approach to problems and the solutions you used. 

**Consideration of Third-Party Feedback**  
You should seek opinion from others on the quality of your work and reflect on this. Have a handful of people use your site and complete a short questionnaire for example. Include the results, but then go on to discuss them.

**Quality of Self-Evaluation**  
A good evaluation will demonstrate an ability to stand back from your work and critically evaluate it. What worked, what didn’t, and what could be improved.

###Overview
In semester 1 you produced an individual piece of web work. For this coursework you will produce a full website or web-based application. 

The actual website or application you produce is up to you. You are encouraged to develop something that you will find personally interesting. Some examples include:

* A portfolio website showcasing a range of creative work (audio, video, photography…)  
* A website for a band that includes discography, live dates, and streams music from their latest release  
* A website for a film that includes a trailer as well as interviews with the cast and a countdown to release  
* A digital story that allows the reader to follow a range of paths through the narrative, incorporating graphics, audio, and video  
* An online music video for a song that uses multiple windows as the song progresses  
* A simple web-based game  

Some key points to consider include:

* The stylistic design of the site including colour and font choices.  
* The use of text copy   
* The inclusion of social media options for sharing  
* The usability and accessibility of the website   
* Your target audience and what this means for the site design  
* Use of graphics, audio, animation and video  
* Demonstration of the techniques covered in the module  


The content should be your own.  All content that is not yours (images, music, sound effects, etc.) should be appropriately referenced at a minimum in a list in the documentation (note that Google, or other search engines are not sources of information). Failure to do so is plagiarism and may attract a zero grade. This does not prevent you from getting your colleagues or tutor to criticise early drafts of your work before it is handed in / published.

Any content you produce for your website such as an audio interview will be marked primarily on its suitability for web deployment rather than its own production value. For example, a video that is stored at a much larger size than it is displayed at would be a no no. You have other modules where you are keenly assessed on the production value of your digital output. Speak to your tutor if you have any questions about this.

There are two main components to this coursework: the website itself and a portfolio of associated documentation. The website attracts 60% of the mark for this coursework, and the documentation 40%.

###Documentation.
**Weighting:** 40% of the coursework mark, broken down as follows.

Your documentation should consist of the following components. 

####Proposal and Initial Designs
**Weighting:** 10% of the coursework mark 
 
This should give an outline of your intended website, including:

* Description that includes an outline of your idea  
* Target audience and possible ramifications for the site design  
* Discussion on the technical challenges your idea poses  
* Initial basic designs for layout and site structure  


####Production  
**Weighting:** 10% of the coursework mark

This should give some insight into the development of your website. Pick three individual components and discuss:

* What you were trying to achieve
* How you did this
* Why you chose the approach you did
* How successful the approach was

Examples of what is meant here by an individual component of your website include a slideshow, a dropdown menu, an accordian display, an animated transition between pages and so on. 

####Evaluation
**Weighting:** 20% of the coursework mark  

You should address the following points:

* Provide evidence of testing (e.g. all links work, media loads, the site is consistent across browsers).
